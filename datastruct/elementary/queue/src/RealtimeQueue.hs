-- Definition
--   A Queue is consist of a front list f and a rear list r.
--   Add new element to tail, extract from head

--   State for increamental realization for f ++ reverse r
--   n: number of elements remaining in f
data State a = Empty
             | Reverse Int [a] [a] [a] [a] -- n, acc_f, f, acc_r, r
             | Concat Int [a] [a]          -- n, acc, rev_f
             | Done [a]  -- f' = f ++ reverse r

-- Skip the empty error for pop and front
instance Queue RealtimeQueue where
    empty = RTQ [] 0 Empty [] 0
